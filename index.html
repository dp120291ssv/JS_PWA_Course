                Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a new software development methodology. Unlike
                traditional applications, progressive web apps are a hybrid of regular web pages (or websites) and a
                mobile application.
            </div>
            <div class="right-text-b">
                PWAs utilize the power of web tools like service workers and IndexedDB to provide users with a better
                web experience or sometimes, an offline first experience.
            </div>
            <div class="right-text-c">
                Progressive Web Apps are web applications that have been designed so they are capable, reliable, and
                installable. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific
                application.
            </div>
            <div class="right-text-d">
                Between modern APIs, Web Assembly, and new and upcoming APIs, web applications are more capable than
                ever, and those capabilities are only growing.
            </div>
            <div class="right-text-e">
                Users love apps that respond to interaction in the blink of an eye, and an experience they can depend
                on.
            </div>
            <div class="right-text-f">
                When a Progressive Web App moves out of a tab and into a standalone app window, it transforms how users
                think about it and interact with it.
